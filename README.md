# New to PowerShell?
Here's some quick start steps:
Download the repo and unzip it to "C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\TabroomSummary"
Import the module's .psd1 file using Import-Module <path of .psd1 file>
You can then use the public functions like Get-PFSideBiasData. Just find a tournament ID off Tabroom to use.
